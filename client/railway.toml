# /client/railway.toml
# Config-as-Code for the frontend (React + Vite)
# This service is a Static Site deployed from /client/dist.
# Railway serves /dist automatically when we set `static.directory`.

[build]
builder = "RAILPACK"
# For Vite, the default Railpack behavior works out of the box,
# but we explicitly set the build to be clear:
buildCommand = "npm run build"

[deploy]
# Static output directory for Vite
# Railway will publish these assets and ignore startCommand for static services.
static = { directory = "dist" }

# If you preview locally on Railway’s runtime (non-static), you can keep a startCommand:
# startCommand = "npx serve -s dist -l 4173"

# Environment to set in the service UI (after API is live):
#   VITE_API_BASE = https://<your-api-service>.up.railway.app
