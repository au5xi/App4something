# App 4 something ("Up 4 something") — Web Prototype (v2)

This is a full-stack prototype for inviting friends to events and tracking "Up for something" availability.

## Stack
- **Frontend:** React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- **DB:** PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM
- **Auth:** JWT + bcrypt

## Features in this version
- PostgreSQL database
- Events are **private**: you only see events where you are **host / co-host / invited / joined / interested**
- Events list (formerly Join) shows cards (2 per row) and links to an Event page
- Event page: info, attendees row + modal, and shoutbox
- Host: invite friends + add co-hosts via modal picker, add notes, location, potential flag
- Friends: compact grid (3 per row) + live search (after 3 chars) + accept/deny requests
- Status: 4-week availability calendar + location toggle (Home / Custom)
- Profile page: bio + avatar URL
- Calendar page: filter by friends and view their 4-week availability timeline

> No images are generated by the app. Image fields use URL strings. You can plug in placeholder URLs.
